# Problem Description

#### Problem

Given a sequence of non-negative integers a0,…,an−1, find the maximum pairwise product, that is, the largest integer that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence (or, more formally, max(0≤i≠j≤n−1) ai aj). Different elements here mean ai and aj with i≠j (it can be the case that ai=aj).


#### Input format

The first line of the input contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a0,…,an−1 (separated by spaces).


**Constraints**

2≤n≤2⋅105; 0≤a0,…,an−1≤10^5.


**Output format **

Output a single number — the maximum pairwise product.
